                <h3>Game Development Addendum</h3>
                <p><strong>Game Logic:</strong> The game uses a 5x5 grid where each square can be toggled on and off. Clicking on a square toggles its state and the state of adjacent squares. The game ends when all squares are off.</p>
                <p><strong>CSS Styling:</strong> The game grid is created using CSS grid layout. Squares are styled with basic colors, and the "off" state is represented by black, while the "on" state is white.</p>
                <p><strong>JavaScript Usage:</strong> The game logic is written in JavaScript, where we use a 2D array to track the state of the grid. We also handle user interactions, random solvable grid setup, and win detection with JavaScript.</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> The main challenge was generating a random solvable configuration. To solve this, I started with an all-white board and toggled random squares to ensure that the final configuration was solvable.</p>
